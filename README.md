# ILGISA 2023

This year, I'm only doing *one* presentation. But I thought I might build a technical workshop to go with it!

This repo initially serves as a collection of resources to go with a presentation at the May Regional Conference in Chicago. As the technical workshop develops, those files will be included here.

# So, what is this?

The focus on this year's presentation / workshop is: **Creating and Updating a Live, Localized Extract of OpenStreetMap**

## Requirements

Running `imposm` requires a bash terminal. Windows users, do not despair! You can use Docker or Windows Subsystem Linux to run all of this without turning your back on Microsoft. The workshop portion will attempt to demonstrate all options, but we'll see as development continues.

Pretty much everything else is cross-platform.
